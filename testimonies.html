						<p> I joined NPower with little experience and knowledge in IT, but I was very eager

							you acquire your A+ certification, it’s free of cost, has a great location and
							classroom, offers site visits to big companies, internship experience and graduation
							ceremony at the end. I’ve learned to be more confident and to learn
							from my mistakes because that will help me grow and understand the information
							I am learning. I have met and learned from great people and wonderful
							teachers. The skills and fundamentals that I have learnt such as networking,
							hardware, and much more will be with me for years to come. The best is yet to
							come and I am very excited for the future.

						I was at a crossroad in my life, working as a shift supervisor at McDonald’s,
						not too sure where I wanted to go next, but after hearing about the NPower
						program, great opportunity had shown itself. Ever since I was young, I had
						huge passion for technology but never knew how to pursue. NPower gave
						me the means by giving us a capable teacher to help achieve CompTIA A+
						certification and by giving me the connection I needed to get my foot in the IT
						world. From this program, I made many new friends who have supported me
						through the program, helping me grow as a person and soon to be IT professional.
						I will never forgot these people and experiences from the past weeks.
						My future plan is to use everything I learned from the NPower program and to
						give thanks for the opportunity by furthering my education in technology and
						starting a career for myself in the IT world.

						<div id="bio3">
						<p> I always had an interest in technology and was fascinated with the many versatile
                        functions in which people interact with computers. However, I didn’t understand
                        the fundamentals of technology. I instinctively grabbed the opportunity
                        to advance my technological skills when I first heard about the NPower
                        program from a youth employment center. It was a difficult feat trying to balance
                        this program while completing my post-secondary degree, but it was
                        made possible with the aid of peers and staff at NPower. By sharing the same
                        passion for technology, we enhanced each other’s strengths while mitigating
                        our weaknesses and pushed forward for the finish line. My plan after NPower
                        is further improving my skills, staying in contact with my new peers and setting
                        a prime example for future NPower candidates!

						<p>
						In April 2014, I completed Software Engineering and Interactive Gaming at
                        Centennial College. At first, I was searching for a job coding and programming,
                        but after half a year of looking, I thought to myself that I need to explore
                        what else there is for me in the IT field. A friend of mine had referred
                        me to NPower since he was not in the required age group of the program and
                        thought that I would have a better chance in succeeding and to get my foot
                        on the door in the IT field. NPower has helped me in so many ways such as
                        preparing me to get my A+ certificate and for my interviews, learning different
                        roles in the IT field, and extending my network through friends I met in the
                        program, site visits, and guest speakers. Joining NPower has been truly one
                        of the best decisions I made in my life.

						<h4>Dornel Phillips, 25, Toronto
						<br>Internship: Compass Group</h4>
						<div id="bio5">
						<p> Like many Canadians, my journey in Canada began as a newcomer. I came to
                        Canada with the dream of not only obtaining, but achieving more than I would
                        in my place of birth. I was born in Guyana and came to Canada at the age of 9.
                        Over the years, I discovered I was a person who had many interests and technology,
                        especially new ones, was one of them. Before becoming a member of
                        the TSC class in Canada, I attended university for business. After graduation,
                        like many of my peers, I was unable to find proper employment. I started to
                        work part time with youth which in itself is rewarding. It was at that job I was
                        introduced to this opportunity. When I started at NPower I knew more than
                        average about computers, but being part of this program has increased my
                        knowledge by leaps and bounds. The technical training has been great, but
                        the networking, site visits, guest speakers and professional development have
                        also been invaluable. I want to say being part of this program has opened so
                        many doors for me. Doors I wasn’t always privy to. I plan to further my education,
                        as well as my presence in the technology and business field as the two go
                        hand in hand. Thank you NPower, my teacher and classmates.

						<div id="bio6"> 
						<p>
						Graduating from NPower Canada, I have definitely gained more valuable work
                        experience and technical knowledge than most of my years at University. Prior
                        to completing the Technology Service Corps program, I was just a regular student
                        pursing a regular degree with no job to gain experience and not enough
                        experience to land a job. However, during the program, I was equipped with
                        priceless insights from relevant speakers, opportunities through notable companies
                        associated with NPower, and the colossal amount of support from the
                        instructors and staff working for our own professional development. After being
                        in a class of genuinely motivated students, that environment has forever
                        shaped my future ambitions for the better. After graduation, I plan on pursing
                        a business idea that will allow me to Pay It Forward to others. Thank You
                        NPower for pushing me in the right direction.

						<div id="bio7">
						<p> I came into this program without any professional experience or education in
                        technology. I had been working on a casual, part time basis at the TTC at the
                        time, and I wasn’t even sure if it was a program for me because it was completely
                        new. But the challenge of learning about technology and the tools we
                        use every day was very intriguing. I worked hard to learn what I could and am
                        very happy with my decision to join this program. In the end, I met great people,
                        learned new skills and now have full-time employment at CDI Computers
                        as a Bilingual Customer Service Rep. I have a newfound interest in learning
                        and working in technology and plan to continue learning by going to Seneca
                        College in computer programming. I am excited to be in my new career and
                        look forward to what there is for me in the future.

						NPower has given me an experience that I will never forget. Before NPower,
                    I was working as a security guard and volunteering with Young GE as a peer
                    mentor and youth leader. While I was looking for employment, NPower came
                    to my rescue. Not only giving me numerous employment opportunities, they
                    provided me with skill sets that not a lot of people can say they have. With all
                    the support and encouragement I have received throughout the whole program,
                    I feel like I am now equipped with the knowledge and the talent that I
                    need to get my career in IT started.

						<p> Before this program, I was working part-time as a flower vendor and occasional
                    childcare provider. I had very little experience in technology other than
                    taking some courses in high school. Now that I’m in this program and getting
                    back into it, I look back and wonder why I never pursued an education in technology.
                    I really enjoy what I’ve been learning and hope to continue learning
                    more. I also am grateful for the internship experience, where I am finally putting
                    into practice the theory we’ve been learning. I really found this program

						one day, while I was browsing online for jobs, I saw NPower on a community

						expand and focus my technical knowledge, and hopefully gain employment in
						a field that I excel in. Along the way, I made a lot of friends and connections.
						My self-esteem flourished because of NPower professional development. I am
						really thankful for being accepted into this program. It helped me grow and
						gain a lot of knowledge and training. Hopefully 10-15 years from now, I will be
						a System Administrator or Network Administrator then attend an alumni event

						Before NPower, I spent about three years in University doing an arts program
                        that never fit me. I was lost and decided to pull the plug on University. So
                        I found a job in Security; a job that didn’t fit and never challenged what I
                        thought I was capable of. I did however enjoy the company of my coworkers.
                        We spent a lot of time dreaming of our future but never having the courage to
                        step out of our comfort zone, and this kept me there for well over two years.
                        Recognizing that I had a spark for technology, I applied to a three-year college
                        level IT program and was accepted to start in January 2015. The problem was,
                        I couldn’t afford it. When I first heard of the NPower program through a radio
                        station, I thought it sounded too good to be true but applied anyway. Since
                        then, my time in the program has been nothing short of magical. Our site
                        tours and guest speakers have been monumental in helping me figure out a
                        path in the IT industry. NPower has given me a broomstick, an owl, box full of
                        every flavor beans and a train full of friends. I could not be any happier and
                        excited for my journey. Thank you.
