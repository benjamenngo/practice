Youth unemployment stands above 20%, among the highest in Canada. At the same time, 106,000 more Information and Communication Technology (ICT) workers will need to be hired to meet Canadian employer demands by 2016 (ICTC-CTIC, Outlook 2011-2016). While women comprise 47% of the workforce, only 29% of ICT workers are female. Similarly, although new Canadians are 20% of the workforce, but only comprise 5% of ICT workers (Ryerson University, 2008). NPower Canada is committed to closing the diversity gap and providing young adults with the opportunity and tech skills to help them achieve their potential.
